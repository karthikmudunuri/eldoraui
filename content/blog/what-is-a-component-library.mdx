## What Is a Component Library?

A **component library** is a collection of reusable UI componentsâ€”like buttons, cards, modals, tooltips, and inputsâ€”that are built with consistency, scalability, and reusability in mind. These components follow a design system and are built to be plug-and-play across different projects.

Instead of writing a new button or form layout for every app, developers use component libraries to build UIs faster with consistent, tested, and customizable blocks.

> Think of it as Lego blocks for the frontend. Build once, reuse everywhere.

## Why Use a Component Library?

Whether you're a developer, designer, or working in a team, component libraries come with a long list of benefits:

### âš¡ Faster Development
You donâ€™t need to build UI components from scratch. That means more time spent on **business logic** and less on button padding or color consistency.

### ðŸ§© Consistency in Design
Using a shared library ensures that your entire application or product ecosystem looks and behaves uniformly across all screens and devices.

### ðŸ“¦ Reusability
Write once, use anywhere. This is especially powerful in design systems for large teams or companies with multiple products.

### ðŸ”§ Customization & Scalability
Most modern component libraries (like **Eldora UI**) are built with tools like **Tailwind CSS** and **Framer Motion**, allowing easy customization while retaining core functionality.

## Examples of Popular Component Libraries

Here are some of the most widely used component libraries in the web ecosystem:

- **Radix UI** â€“ Accessible and unstyled primitives.
- **ShadCN UI** â€“ Beautifully styled components using Tailwind CSS and Radix.
- **Chakra UI** â€“ Themeable, accessible components for React.
- **Material UI (MUI)** â€“ Google's material design for React apps.
- **Eldora UI** â€“ A growing, modern component library built with React, Tailwind, TypeScript, and Framer Motion (yes, this is our own ðŸš€).
