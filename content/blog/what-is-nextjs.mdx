## What Is Next.js?

**Next.js** is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build fast, scalable, and production-ready web applications. Developed by **Vercel**, it extends React with essential features like server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and more—making it a go-to choice for full-stack and frontend developers alike.

Whether you're building a blog, a portfolio, a dashboard, or an enterprise-grade app, Next.js brings both **performance** and **developer experience** to the table.

## 🔥 Best Features of Next.js

### ⚙️ Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Render pages on the server at request time—ideal for SEO-heavy pages.

### 🧱 Static Site Generation (SSG)
Pre-render pages at build time for lightning-fast load speeds.

### 🚀 App Router & File-Based Routing
Next.js 13+ introduced the **App Router**, with nested layouts and server components for improved modularity and scalability.

### 🧑‍🍳 API Routes
Easily create backend functionality without spinning up a separate server—useful for handling form submissions, webhooks, or database connections.

### 🌍 Internationalization (i18n)
Built-in support for multilingual apps with route-based language detection.

### 🎨 Built-in CSS Support + Tailwind Integration
Seamlessly integrate Tailwind CSS, SCSS modules, and even CSS-in-JS solutions.

### 🧪 Full TypeScript Support
Next.js works great with TypeScript out of the box, making large-scale development safer and more maintainable.
