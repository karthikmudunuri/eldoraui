EldoraUI started because of my passion for beautiful design and my desire to contribute to the frontend community.

Hi, I'm [**Karthik Mudunuri**](https://www.karthikmudunuri.in/), and I built EldoraUI in 2024. I was deeply inspired by the incredible work of shadcn/ui, Aceternity UI, and Magic UI. These libraries showed me what was possible when developers come together to create beautiful, reusable components.

I wanted to create something that would help other developers build stunning interfaces without spending countless hours on design details. The goal was simple: provide high-quality, copy-paste components that developers could use to focus on what matters most - building great products.

**What I didn't expect was the incredible response from the developer community.**

Within less than a week of launching EldoraUI, I received an overwhelming amount of love and support from developers around the world. The community embraced the library with enthusiasm, and the feedback was incredibly positive.

Here are some of the amazing tweets from developers who used EldoraUI:

The response has been incredible, and it motivates me to continue building and improving EldoraUI. This is just the beginning of our journey together.

Thank you to everyone who has supported EldoraUI and helped make it what it is today. Your feedback, contributions, and enthusiasm drive me to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible with UI components.
